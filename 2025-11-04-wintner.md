# San-Franchini, McIntyre, and Fernandes' Thoughts on Generative AI
In this article, authors San-Franchini, McIntyre, and Fernandes define their reasoning for refusing to the use of generative AI in academic settings. While many people think that refusing to use AI is ignorant and a refusal for advancement, the authors argue that their refusal is based in moral and ethical concerns. Their refusal is informed and a concious choice that they have made, and their article is trying to persuade the reader into making the same choice.  

The authors provide different "premises" that set up their refusal for using Generative AI: 
1. "Writing studies teacher-scholars understand the relationship between language, power, and persuasion. 
2. Writing studies teacher-scholars understand the broad purposes and uses of writing in the world. 
3. Writing studies as a discipline stands against linguistic homogenization, which is accelerated and advanced by GenAI. 
4. Writing studies as a discipline rejects punitive approaches to plagiarism and plagiarism surveillance. 
5. Writing studies scholarship has demonstrated that technologies, including GenAI, are never ideologically neutral. 
6. Writing studies as a discipline has taken up histories of digital writing technologies that provide important context for understanding our current GenAI moment. 
7. Writing teachers are well-poised to understand the range of labor issues that come with GenAI adoption. 
8. Writing teachers must be critical of the rhetorical and economic contexts surrounding GenAI, including the various ways that GenAI is promoted and marketed.
9. Writing studies must consider the environmental impacts of GenAI as well as other digital technologies that rely on massive datasets such as Zoom and Facebook. 
10. Refusal can be a principled and pragmatic response to the incursion of GenAI technologies in college writing courses."

## What Can Refusal Do for the Future of AI? 
By refusing to engage in the use of generative AI, the authors hope that new ethics will emerge for holding technology accountable and to more "human" standards. Instead of relying heavily on AI and what it can do for us, the authors want to take back human agency and redirect the power from AI back to the human users. 

## Link to Classmates' Posts
According to the post "Dangers of Biases in GenAI" the author says that AI programs often circulate harmful and discriminatory rhetoric. If this is the case, then the arguments made by San-Franchini, McIntyre, and Fernandes are compelling. Why would users purposefully want to spread harmful rhetoric? Another post entitled "Discriminatroy Function Generative AI" describes that AI is a product of its environment. So, when the AI in is a sphere that spreads discrimination, that is what it will deliver to the user. In order to combat this, users can choose to refuse to use GenAI, which will help stop the spread of discriminatory speech. 

## Next Steps? 
Ultimately, the choice to use or not to use AI is up to the user. It is important to note that AI does have consequences, moral implications, and ethical concerns that users should be aware of whenever they use a GenAI platform.
