<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Scientific communication can be defined as “conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party” (Young 1). This form of communication aims to complete three goals: educate, archive, and promote. But, when this communication has turned to utilizing forms of digital rhetoric it can be hard to simplify, prove credibility, and reach the inteded audiences.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">When trying to move scientific communication to digital platforms, specifically YouTube, creators have to take into account a variety of aspects to acheive their intended purpose. These aspects include audience interaction, rhetorical velocity, and algorithmic success.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=5 data-line-end=6 ><a id="Audience_Interaction_5"></a>Audience Interaction</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">With YouTube audience interaction can be measured through views, shares, likes, and comments. In the article, “We Lied to You…And We’ll Do It Again,” the study showed measured success by audience appreciation, reflection, and focus on content.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=7 data-line-end=8 ><a id="Rhetorical_Velocity_7"></a>Rhetorical Velocity</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Rhetorical velocity can be defined as “a way of considering delivery as a rhetorical mode, aligned with an understanding of how texts work as a component of a strategy” (Ridolfo p. 1). When trying to explain complex subjects to a wide audience via YouTube this can become difficult, escpecially when considering the rapid discourse and delivery that’s utilized in this platform. An overwhelming amount of information avaliable can make it difficult to discern what scientific theories and concepts presented are relevant and true.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=9 data-line-end=10 ><a id="Algorthim_9"></a>Algorthim</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">The algorithm pushes content to certain viewers and allows for hastags, links, and audience interaction to be easier. But, this can also be a problem, as some scientific communication may be intended for people with greater knowledge of a subject or may take an oversimplified concept and become misinformed. In our previous reading, “Computers and Compositions” Glotfelter discusses the “…concerns about whether algorithms and the engineers creating them have been afforded the power to decide what is relevant and irrelevant socially, culturally, and politically” (Glotfelter 3). I feel that this concept is especially relevant when discussing scienctific communication when the ideas presented are usually seen as fact and readily believed, or the opposite, the ideas presented are taken extremely skeptically. When the algorithm has the power to provide online communities with information rapidly it can be difficult for digital rhetoric to be seen as trustworthy and relevant.</p>
