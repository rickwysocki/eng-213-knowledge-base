# What is "Literacy" and Why Do We Use It For Everything? 
In *Blinded by the Letter: Why Are We Using Literacy as a Metaphor for Everything Else?*, authors Anne Wysocki and Johndan Johnson-Eilola present the argument that the term "literacy" is used too loosely, and has lost its meaning.

### The True Definition of Literacy
Our knowledge of the term "literacy" is often associated with books and how well we can comprehend what is said inside them. In modern academia, "literacy" is connected to almost every word: technology, media, art, etc. Wysocki and Eilola create two sections in their essay to explore the vast expanse of "literacy": stories of literacy and objects associated with literacy. 

### Bundle 1: Stories
Being literate allows for social and political liberation, as seen through many different writings like the Declaration of Independence and policy. The authors argue that literacy has never been neutral and has always been tied to movement. While it has been associated with liberation, the Myth of Literacy posits that literacy does not guarantee advancement, rather it reinforces class divides with the false pretense of freedom. Historically, literacy has only been afforded to the wealthy. Those who know how to read and write are the ones who stimulate social change, while those who are not as fortunate are left behind the wheel of progress. 

### Bundle 2: Objects 
Our understanding of literacy is dependent on the object with which we receive literacy, most commonly the book. Being able to write down intricate ideas that could be spread to other people who were literate propelled society forward, connecting people together in ways they hadn't been before. If our understanding of literacy is heavily tied to books, then, Wysocki and Eilola posit, how can media literacy exist? Technology works differently than books, so delivering the term "literacy" to media and technology would change the definiton of "literacy".

### Next Steps 
Wysocki and Eilola's solution for this "literacy problem" is simple: find a different term instead of lumping everything together. In order to fully understand the newness of technology and the rich history of books, they need to have separate terms that best reflect their usage.
