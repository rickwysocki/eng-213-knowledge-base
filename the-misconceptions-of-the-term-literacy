title: # The Misconceptions of the Term *Literacy*
layout: page
---
From today's reading, the authors Anne Wysocki and Johnada Johnson-Eilola explain
how the term *literacy* has been overused to the point that it has lost its
original meaning. They ask two questions throughout the reading to show the
relationships between printed words and technology and how people today can relate
their uses of technology to other areas of their lives.
### The Importance of Technological Literacy in the Classroom
On page 353, the authors list four ways that show why children need to have
technological literacy and how teachers can teach those skills in the classroom.
1. The first step is for the teachers to be technologically literate first before
they teach their students how to use the various technologies.
2. The second step is to include more forms of online learning and incorporating
different softwares that the students can use.
3. The third step is for the schools to supply functional computers for both the
students and the teachers to use.
4. The last step is for both teachers and their students to have access to
information that branches outside their immediate surroundings.
### How "Literacy" Is Not Meant to Fix Problems
On pages 355 and 359, the authors use an interesting explanation to show how
literacy is not meant to fix problems. They explain that being more "literate" does
not mean that a person's problems in society will automatically go away. Literacy
is only meant to be a tool.
### Using Technology for Other Purposes
Starting on page 361, they describe the term *literacy* in relation to space. Their
main point in this section is not to prioritize space over time (362). Toward the
beginning half of page 363, they also mention that space is not just something that
is physical, but it is also something that can be woven together internally. When
articulating literacy, the authors said it best when they claimed that "literacy
can be seen as not a skill but a process of situating and resituating
representations in social spaces" (367).
These authors' thoughts and ideas show how overused the term *literacy* actually
is. The audience's responsibility is to learn from these misconceptions and see how
literacy can be used in cases that are not just related to technology.
