### The Spread of Information
**The Internet** is a place that is built by information. It's used to store information, send it to other places, and eventually, be obtained. Whether this is through words, pictures, or even something as simple as binary code, there is an obscene amount of information being sent even just every second.

Now, consider the following: 
> How can we understand all of this information as humans?

The answer-- although likely not the one that we wish to hear-- is that we cannot. This is the idea around the video *...And We'll Do it Again* seeing as the channel understands that they cannot discuss everything in full terms in such short videos. Quantum mechanics cannot be learned in a day, much less every other topic on top of that. So in an attempt to make possible that viewers can all understand the topics at hand, the channel tells lies in that they simplify things. The spread of scientific information in simple, easy to understand ways to the general public is known as **science communication**. 

#### Science Communication
Science communication is a lie. Well, not always, but enough to the point where it could be considered something important to mention when discussing the topic. In the easiest way to explain, this is essentially the scholarly way of 'dumbing down' science. It's not neccessarily meant to be calling the person listening dumb, but rather giving them an entry point to the topic which they can use to become smarter over time. It won't be instant, but a good point to jump from is a great way to create that beginning of learning, where we can move from there to more complex and usually truthful topics. For example, if I'm explaining math, I'm going to start by saying that there is nothing below zero. Negative numbers are an added complication that would only serve to confuse somebody more while they are learning subtraction. Once they have the basics down, you can then consider adding those extra complications that create a truthful understanding.

#### Conclusion
All in all, the internet is a large place. There's lots of information everywhere, and only so much time that we can take to understand them. Condensing knowledge is the easiest way to create an entry point to new learners, and also one of the few times where lying in a context of facts can make sense, as it's for the cause of learning.
