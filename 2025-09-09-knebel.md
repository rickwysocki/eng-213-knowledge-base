## The Weight of Literacy:

**Literacy** is known as a basic skill required to complete a task or comprehend a subject. However, there lies a much deeper meaning within these seemingly "basic skills". Much of the time we deem literacy as a *gateway* or *prerequisite* to success. This is phrased best by Wysocki and Eilola: 

> "When we speak then of "literacy" as though it was a basic, neutral, contextless set of skills, the word keeps us hoping in the face of lives and arguments to the contrary that there could be an easy cure for economic and social and political pain, that only a lack of literacy keeps people poor or oppressed" (7).

The idea that a simple set of skills can create such a divide is integral to understanding how the world commonly remains the way that it is. Patterns themselves, are literate. They're readable in that with enough time, one can begin to predict them. Think of a sentence, for instance; Certain words must come before nouns, same with verbs, and so on. There is a structure that allows us as speakers of the English language to predict what is coming up next. That sounds anything *other* than basic. But as somebody who understands the concepts, one can do all of that almost subconciously. Literacy itself is a trick to those who have already learned it. A deceit that only serves to make the less fortunate (meaning, those who don't already understand), well, less fortunate.

##### Technological Literacy:

A device is not always easy to use, especially at one's first attempt. This is something more commonly seen within older generations who didn't grow up with the product. Scientifically, when one is past their youth era, it becomes much more difficult to pick up new skills. Technological use is a prominent example of this. Wysocki and Eilola touch on this idea as well:

> "When we say or write "technological literacy" how can we not expect others to hear, even if only partially, that we believe there is some minimum set of technological skills everyone should have-and that it is their own fault if they do not have them?" (12).

Although on a much smaller, and more personal scale than ideas of poverty or oppression, the quick pace of technology and digital media as a whole can be difficult for anybody to follow. It becomes even more difficult to find the will to follow such topics if one didn't grow up with them in the first place. We, as people, are motivated to avoid that which makes us uncomfortable. The only way to get better, or get over your fears, is to push through this. Now for a second, imagine how much more difficult it would be to get over these fears if it's deemed as such a simple thing to do. Being afraid of messing something up on a device that everybody else just uses without any fear. It sounds demoralizing just typing it, to the point where I cannot even fathom how it would feel to experience it. This lack of confidence is where many manage to avoid development of their own digital literacies. This, then, turns the process into an infinite cycle. The individual realizes that they don't understand something, loses more confidence in themselves within the subject, and then never works up the courage to sit down and learn it from the start. It's something that isn't just digital, but is inherently literate.

##### Conclusion:

Literacy as a concept, although simple in description, is complex in execution. The greater span of an individual's life could be spent attempting to reach the same level of literacy that it took another days to reach. It's a scale that is built to house those who are more prepared to learn. But what it really should track is simply the rate at which one is learning, not the result. Literacy reinforces the norm. But it doesn't have to.


The sources and refrences that were refrenced were very informative, I would keep them but maybe figure out a way to break them down into bullet points or something.
All the defintions explained in this markdown assignment intrgued me well and doesn't need to be rephrased in any way.
I have no thoughts or ideas that could make this better as it is alredy in a perfect state.
