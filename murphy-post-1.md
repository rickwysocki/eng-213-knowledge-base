### The Two Main Questions Presented by this Article (_put simply_):
**1. What are the results of interacting with every technology as if it were printed words?**

**2. What possibilities does shedding the term and structre of 'literacy' provide?**
 

#### Question 1 
- **"A Bundle of Stories"**
        - 'literacy' is more than a set of skills
        - it doesn't immediately solve problems
        - it is rather used as a distraction from social and political situations
- **"Objects We Address Through the Revolution of Literacy"**
        - people have become too dependent on books and printed words
        - other things, such as art and music, are often overlooked and deemed less relevant/useful than printed text
        - the word 'literacy' holds value and shouldn't be used loosely to make the word after it seem more important
        - we should be coming up with new words to better describe what we _really_ mean when we use the word 'literacy'

#### Question 2
- **"Literacy in Space"**
        - experiencing information without viewing it in a linear, time-based, structured way
        - space > time 
        - 'literacy' is focused on functioning with new technology and making connections between information
        - seeing all information "at once"
        - reliant on the creation of ways to access + navigate information easily and quickly
        - this way of thinking about literacy is both freeing, because it opens you up to ideas outside of the limited, linear view, but also
        limiting because it can be overwhelming to view it without a linear lens
- **"Articulating Literacy"**
        - articulate can mean to speak/utter OR a form of connection
        - literacy - isn't a fixed idea that's always used the same way, but rather an ongoing process of using ideas and communication 
        depending on the situation


These can be used to discuss the pros and cons of using a certain form of communication, and these things can change with that

***so basically...***
> This essay is offering many different ways to view and define literacy. I don't think it was trying to convince us that one of them is the superior way of thinking about literacy, but it was trying to offer new perspectives to think about when discussing literacy and to question our current understanding of it.
