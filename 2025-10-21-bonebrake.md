# **The Negative Side of GenAI in Writing**

## **Today’s Reading**

  Today’s reading discusses the limitations of GenAI in writing. The authors list ten 
premises that show why they think GenAI technologies are not useful in writing and 
include outside sources to strengthen their reasoning. To focus on three out of the ten 
premises, they explain how plagiarism is not fully detected by GenAI (Premise 4), the 
history of digital writing lays the foundation for today’s GenAI technologies (Premise 6), 
and that GenAI has environmental effects for other platforms that rely on it like Zoom 
and Facebook (Premise 9).
1.	Plagiarism is not fully detected by GenAI (Premise 4).
      The authors make interesting points in their thoughts about plagiarism and 
      GenAI. They mention that plagiarism should not be the main focus when 
      GenAI is used since they believe that it is overemphasized and that it affects a 
      teacher’s trust in their students.

2.	The history of digital writing lays the foundation for today’s GenAI technologies (Premise 6).
    This premise gives some background as to where GenAI originated from. 
    Some examples include the movable type, print capitalism, technical 
    communication (Hart-Davidson et al. “The History”; Hart-Davidson et al. 
    “Revisiting”), the internet, and social media. Bolter also mentions how 
    people were reluctant to accept these new technologies when they were first 
    introduced (Bolter). The authors’ main point is to critical weigh the benefits 
    and consequences of how GenAI is used for problem-solving purposes.

3.	GenAI has environmental effects for other platforms that rely on it like Zoom and Facebook (Premise 9).
    This premise focuses on the environmental effects of GenAI since it relies on 
    water and electricity to run it. Apparently, the resources that are used to 
    make GenAI possible are hurting the environment, and research has been 
    done to show prove that point.

## **Applications from Previous Readings and Class Discussions**

  For Premise 4 about plagiarism, I do not agree with the authors on this point since
GenAI should be a concern for plagiarism. From our previous class discussions, we 
mention how using GenAI does result in plagiarism since a student cannot cite where he 
got his information from and also cannot check the reliability of that source.

  For Premise 6 about the foundation for GenAI, Jiang, Vetter, and Lucia’s article about 
ChatGPT in technical writing can be used in conjunction with today’s article. In their 
article, they explore the five rhetorical canons of GenAI (invention, arrangement, style, 
memory, and delivery), which is like a foundation for understanding how GenAI is used
in writing (Jiang, Vetter, and Lucia 4).

  For Premise 9 about the environmental effects of GenAI, Doctorow’s article about “The 
‘Enshittification’ of TikTok” shows a different angle to environmental effects that are 
more societal effects. Doctorow summarizes his point at the beginning about how a 
platform dies because it first treats its users well; next, it abuses them by trying to get 
more money from them; and lastly, the users abandon the platform (Doctorow). This 
example is a link to environmental effects because it would affect businesses that could 
correlate to environmental impacts as well.

This knowledge base discussion post mainly focuses on the concept of oversimplification 
and how harmful it can be in conveying information without explaining its context 
beforehand. Oversimplification can be misleading since it does not include everything 
that the audience would need to know. Even though this post is not about GenAI, 
oversimplification can be applied to it since it is used to condense writing without 
explaining the context of where the information is coming from.

2.	[2025-09-30-hymes.md] (https://github.com/Rmlb25/eng-213-knowledge-base/blob/main/2025-09-30-hymes.md)
This knowledge base discussion post mainly discusses the redefinition of digital literacy. 
It mainly focuses on how digital literacy is a skill and that it can be used in multiple forms 
of media. Even though his post is also not about GenAI, GenAI can be viewed as a digital 
literacy since the person using it needs to know how it works to use it appropriately.

3.	[2025-09-30-couch.md] (https://github.com/Rmlb25/eng-213-knowledge-base/blob/main/2025-09-30-couch.md)
This knowledge base discussion post mainly focuses on the difference between a lie and 
an oversimplification. The author’s main point shows that the main distinction is the 
intention behind it that would distinguish the information being a lie or an 
oversimplification. Although this post is not about GenAI, the principles above can be 
used to discern how AI is being used whether it is really oversimplifying information to 
the point where it could be used to give misinformation to those using it.
