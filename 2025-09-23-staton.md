Young et al. in ["We Lied to You... and We'll Do It Again"
â€” Communicating Science via YouTube](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/30.1/topoi/young-et-al/)" defines "long tail" as "a focus on the long-term view". They also further explain and exemplify long tail in multiple ways, as science is the main topic being discussed in the reading:

> One of these blind spots is that trending practices and recommendations do not always allow for a focus on the long-term view, something we call the "long tail" of science communication. This long tail recognizes that current practices and science communication offerings can prevail long beyond an initial encounter. Such moments can even prompt particular audience members to significantly alter what would have been a very different life.

The authors provide specifc examples through the comments and reactions to the YouTube video, "[We Lied to You...And We'll Do It Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFqn3uy238E)" they are basing their writing about. The comments are clearly relevant as far as showcasing long tail effects as the audience shows their approval of the narrative style in which Kurzgesagt presents science. Most comments that the authors present show how the audience has overwhelming support of the video and describes how they have been inspired by the YouTube channel's content. 

Relating the idea of long tail to "[Writing is a Technology that Restructures Thought](https://bsu.instructure.com/courses/174253/assignments/2193241?module_item_id=5904058)", Ong describes Plato basically cursing the new invention of writing. He thought it was vile. Although he is a widely known and respected as a philosopher, the long tail of his ideology on writing did not transfer over to our modern concept of writing. 
"Plato's objections against writing are essentially the very same objections commonly urged today against computers by those who object to them," (pg. 27)
