### Online Content and Scientific Accessibility
Online communication methods, like Youtube, have the potential to be both excellent sources of information as well as rapid distributors of misinformation. This correlates to previous ideas presented in our readings about how digital media moves very quickly and can become overwhelming for people interacting with it. 
When the presented information is factual, however, communicating science in this manner can allow for people who may have previously been excluded from a given scientific field to break into the genre, gain an entry level of understanding, and expand the larger conversation around the topic at hand. As Young et al. iteratates, "digital media...might lead to diversifying who is involved and engaged in science communication" This idea relates to how the algorithm pushes certain content to different audiences and how scientific information should be explained to reach audiences with varying degrees of knowledge on subjects presented.
## Whose Voices are Being Heard?
Digital media is an excellent transmitter of simpler, entry level scientific ideas (the simplification being a key aspect, as described in the indroduction section of "We Lied to You... and We'll Do It Again"
â€” Communicating Science via YouTube by Young et al.). This accessibility and quick spread of knowledge is a vital affordance of this form of education. Youtube is free to watch and distribute, and watching a science based Youtube video is far less intimidating than attempting to read an entire textbook, for example. There truly is a lot of good that can come out of Youtube's scientific community. It is important to acknowledge, however, that even though digital media can serve as a means to diversify scientific learners, the foundation is still built upon a community of people who earned their scientific knowledge through more traditional, inaccessible means. Voice and credibility are key. For more information, see AsapSCIENCE's (a science based Youtube channel specializing in the simplified and consistend scientific videos that have been discussed) video, "We Need to Talk About Diversity in Science" linked below:

## Concluding Thoughts
Overall, like many other forms of digital communication, scientific communication through forms like Youtube have their primary benefit in the speed and ease of distribution through sharing links of videos and channels. These same traits, however, are also what makes the medium prone to the spread of misinformation. It is important as digital citizens to approach these topics critically and remain cognizant of what information we are consuming and sharing.
