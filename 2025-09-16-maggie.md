By definition, according to [Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/13.2/topoi/ridolfo_devoss/remix.html) remixing is, "the process of taking old pieces of text, images, sounds, and video and stitching them together to form a new product." (DeVoss, Ridolfo) Creating a new piece of art, in any creative capacity, and pulling inspiration from other sources is not a new practice. Most often new bodies of work (art, music, movies, etc.) take idea from projects that have inspired them. What's new are the tools that creators now have access to when they are "remixing" pre-existing bodies of work. Lawrence Lessig uses [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) as his example labeling it as, "an ideal democratic space in which users take culture, remix culture, rewrite culture, and thus make culture." Anyone can get onto the website to remove information, elaborate on existing information, or to add new information. The Internet has created ways of remixing and recomposing that would not have been possible in the past. 

Another aspect to think about is the process of creation with remixing/recomposing in mind. Have creatives always created with this in mind, or is this a new age thing? Inspiring new work, and inspiring someone to remix existing work are two different things. In a current context, remixing someone's work can be taken literally, as DeVoss and Ridolfo use the song, [Chocolate Rain](https://youtu.be/EwTZ2xpQwpA?si=Qc022W5r3fAiKtEM) by Tay Zonday as their example of people creating their own takes on this song. While this happened on "old YouTube", it has continued to happen to other YouTube songs, or viral videos, as well as on shortform content apps such as Instagram or TikTok. To the original question posed, currently creative bodies of work are being made to go "viral" which lends itself to other works derived from it. This easily lends itself to the answer of yes to the question of "Do artists think about remixing/recomposing when creating?". Combinging the current tools the digital realm provides accessibly for users, and the immediacy of the Internet cultivates numerous chances for remixing.
