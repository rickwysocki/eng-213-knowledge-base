## The Misconceptions of the Term *Literacy* ##

From today's reading, the authors Anne Wysocki and Johnada Johnson-Eilola explain
how the term *literacy* has been overused to the point that it has lost its
original meaning. They ask two questions throughout the reading to show the
relationships between printed words and technology and how people today can relate
their uses of technology to other areas of their lives.
### The Importance of Technological Literacy in the Classroom
The authors list four ways that show why children need to have
technological literacy and how teachers can teach those skills in the classroom (pg. 33)
1. Teachers need to be technologically literate first before
teaching students to use the various technologies.
2. Include more forms of online learning and incorporate
different softwares for students use.
3. Schools should supply functional computers for both
students and teachers use.
4. Both teachers and their students should have access to
information that extends beyond their immediate surroundings.
### How "Literacy" Is Not Meant to Fix Problems
The authors believe that too often people assume that 'literacy' will solve issues in society. They argue 
that literacy is meant to be a a tool, rather than a blanket "fix-all". The authors explain 
that being more "literate" does not mean that a person's problems in society will automatically go away (pg. 355 + 359).
### Using Technology for Other Purposes
Starting on page 361, they describe the term *literacy* in relation to space. Their
main point in this section is not to prioritize space over time (362). Toward the
beginning half of page 363, they also mention that space is not just something that
is physical, but it is also something that can be woven together internally. When
articulating literacy, the authors said it best when they claimed that "literacy
can be seen as not a skill but a process of situating and resituating
representations in social spaces" (pg 367).
These authors' thoughts and ideas show how overused the term *literacy* actually
is. The audience's responsibility is to learn from these misconceptions and see how
literacy can be used in cases that are not just related to technology.
