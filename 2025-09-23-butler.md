# "We Lied to You... and We'll Do It Again" - Communicating Science via Youtube - Long Term Effects


#### The Long Term Effects of Digital Media 

This reading has a large focus on the concept of digital media, in this case specifically science communication, having a long-term impact on the viewers or audience of the media. This long-term impact is also referred to as “the long tail.”

> “The long tail … illustrates a process that pays attention to niche markets and emphasizes the longevity of a product over its immediate success factor” (Young et al. Literature Review)

The long term effects of digital media is explored through the comments on the Youtube video “...And We’ll Do it Again” and through looking at these comments the most common responses fell under three different categories. 

1. Focusing on Content 
2. Showing Appreciation
3. Reflected Affect

Out of these the one that follows the focus of the long tail is number three “Reflected Affect.” In the 50 comments that were looked at 29 of them indicated how the video or channel as a whole had inspired them in some way. Some of them discussed more short term effects such as feeling happy after watching the video. Others mentioned being long time viewers and how the channel has inspired them to pursue a career in science or to further their knowledge after watching.

#### Connections to Other Notes

This post discusses the reading on Ridolfo and DeVoss: Composing for Recomposition, and focuses primarily on the concepts of rhetorical velocity and delivery. I think that rhetorical velocity really ties into the long tail of a piece of media in multiple ways. One way being that the speed in which something is distributed can either make it so that something has a much longer effect on people since they will be seeing it more frequently. Recomposition can also increase the lifespan of a piece of media giving it more time to affect someone long term.

This post discusses the same reading that is discussed in this post meaning quite a few connections can be made such as us both mentioning and defining “long tails.” However, instead of focusing on one particular topic like I did, this post gives a bigger overview of the reading as a whole.

This post discusses the reading on Ridolfo and DeVoss: Composing for Recomposition, and tackles the evolving terminology and redefinition of Rhetoric Delivery. The concept of evolving terminology applies quite well to the concept of a “long tail.” A long tail is the long term effects of content on an audience, and having a definition for that allows for researchers to discuss long term effects without needing to make long academic writings even longer and wordier.
