#### Defenitions and Related Ideas on Literacy in Previous Readings
##### Walter J. Ong - "WRITING IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT RECONSTRUCTS THOUGHT"
Literacy "tends to be thought of as lack of a simple mechanical skill". 

##### Wysocki and Eilola - "Blinded by the Letter"
Importance of Literacy: 
". . . a lack of literacy keeps people poor or oppressed".

##### Young et al. - "We Lied to You . . . and We'll Do It Again"
Using Digital Literacy to Cater to the Digitally Literate: 
" . . . algorithms or existing social network connections that can affect the popularity of a video, other content-driven factors like message, style, duration, and delivery are also frequent targets . . ."

#### Comparing With Current Forms of Literacy
- Keeping these definitions in mind, I think it is interesting to see how these ideas associated with literacy work when looking at digital literacy. 
- This idea started out as a mechanical skill. Is it now? I'd like to think so. I feel like it is common and some might even say expected for people to have literacy in one way or another. Now, it might have more to do with a person's ability to use different forms of digital media. However, it could be argued that there are certain cases where literacy is not mechanical persay and more has to do with understanding rather than technical skill.
- Is digital literacy a "simple and mechanical skill" now? I think in some areas and people it could be, but for others its not. It is interesting to think about how some people are naturally more digitally literate and view it more as a mechanical skill because they were always around this newer media and therefore understand it more.
- Is having a lack of literacy a setback still when looking at digital literacy? I think in some ways. This sort of reminds me of how people have to know how to use technology to some extent to do certain things. Students are expected to know how to use technology in classes, adults might be required to use technology to apply for a job or file their taxes, and people might need to know how to make a video call in order to see their long-distance friends and family. Are there ways people could get around this? Probably. It might be a lot more work, however, and I am curious to see if there will be alternatives in the future with more and more things becoming more digital. 
- New things to consider in literacy is the reach of media. That is something that is much different from time periods without digital communication. Digital media's new addition to the form of literacy continues to add onto the definition of the word.

#### Connections to Other Class Discussions

##### Classmate 1: 2025-09-09-bonebrake.md
When making note of significant points mentioned in her reading, Bonebrake mentions an important way in which modern technology is redefining literacy in the digital age. 
- "The first step is for the teachers to be technologically literate first before they teach their students how to use the various technologies."

Now, teachers are expected to be more digitally literate to do their job more efficiently. This is a small way that with technology, the world is relying more and more on digital literacy.  

##### Classmate 2: 2025-09-09-carlson.md
Carlson discusses new concerns and factors to consider when looking at digital literacy, which is more of an issue with the way digital rhetoric is spread so much easier. 
- "It is important as digital citizens to approach these topics critically and remain cognizant of what information we are consuming and sharing."

Yet again, technology is redefining literacy by adding in more factors to consider when interacting with different forms of media and sources. With upgrades being made more often, this seems to be something that might continue to develop, especially with the continued growth of AI. 

##### Classmate 3: 2025-09-09-knebel.md
Building on significant points mentioned in the reading, Knebel explains the difficulty older generations may have when developing digital literacy.  
- "Scientifically, once one is past their youth, it becomes much more difficult to pick up new skills. Technological use is a prominent example of this."


Taking this into consideration, literacy has changed over time by this simple comparison of digital literacy between generations. Literacy continues to grow and develop with the times and people either have to keep up or will fall behind and if someone falls behind then they are more likely to be limited in multiple different ways.
