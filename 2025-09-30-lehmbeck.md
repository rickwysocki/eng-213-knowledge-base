## New Media Is Not All That
We started our semester together by discussing possible ways in which New Media can be defined. Using the ideas presented by Lev Manovich, we talked specfically about how New Media is constnatally evolving and, therefore, hard to define. One of the limitations of New Media that was mentioned was that New Media is not an ultimate source of knowledge.
> "While non-real time media generation and manipulation via digital computers can be
thought of as speeding up of previously existing artistic techniques, real-time networking
and control seem to constitute qualitatively new phenomena" (Manovich 18).

From this we were also able to engage in an interesting conversation about how New Media appeals to a sense of immediacy where we crave infromation at the touch of our fingertips.

## The Weary Acceptance of Technology
Another topic of class discussion was when we discussed how weary some are of technological advancements. Below is a summary from a classmate's prior knowledge base post:
> "...Many criticize the usage of technology since it limits interactions with other humans. While the spoken language or human interaction allow for in-person feedback and change, writing and computers do not" (Smidebush).

One of the biggest worries of New Media and the adavacments of technology is that it will change the way social interactions look. We discussed how this may have been perpetuated due to how mainstream technology has become (i.e. iPad kids, Zoom Lectures, FaceTime, Social Media). However, advancments in technology is inevitable and it is impossible to not use them due to how heavily integrated they become in society.

## The Simplification of Information
One of the more interesting topics we have discussed is how lieing on the interent is used to spread information that makes sense. Specfically, we talked about how simplifications are pushed onto the internet to make nuanced ideas more digestiable by lay people.
> "Condensing knowledge is the easiest way to create an entry point to new learners, and also one of the few times where lying in a context of facts can make sense, as it’s for the cause of learning" (Knebel).
> [The Spread of Information by Sam Knebel](https://rickwysocki.github.io/eng-213-knowledge-base/2025-09-23-knebel.html)

While it is important to make informtion more digestable, we also considered the consequences of simplifications. We dicussed the importance of providing context behind the simplifications, not oversimplifying and simplification, and not outright lying to audeinces as possible solutions to negate harmful consequences of simplifications.
