# Long Tail Communication and the Importance of Social Media Discourse
- Long Tail of Scientific Communication 
    - "current practices and science communication offerings can prevail long beyond an intial encounter" 
        - Just like in Ridolfo and DeVoss's idea of recomposition, the "long tail" allows for others to rearticulate a scientific idea they have heard to a broader audience

- TRESCA 
    - Collaboration between six institutions around Europe 
    - Focused on addressing the spread of disinformation and the distrust of the media 

- Science Communication 
    - "communication that revolves around the goals of telling the story of science in a compelling way to any range of nonexperts to include expert scientists in different fields"
        - Ong's idea of changing communication/writing

- Digital media lead to new communication and interaction with scientific ideas

- We should not focus on the effectiveness of scientific communication through metrics, but by the longevity of the ideas
