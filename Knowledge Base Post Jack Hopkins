## A digital medium refers to any electronic platform or channel used for the creation, storage, and distribution of digital content, including videos, podcasts, websites, and social media.

### A digital medium encompasses various forms of media that are created, transmitted, and consumed using digital technologies. This includes content that can be processed, analyzed, stored, and distributed by electronic devices such as computers, mobile phones, and the internet. Key characteristics of Digital Mediums include:

- Interactivity: Digital mediums allow for user interaction, enabling audiences to engage with content in real-time.
- Accessibility: They provide global reach, allowing users to access content anytime and anywhere.
- Customization: Digital content can be tailored to specific audiences, enhancing relevance and engagement.
- Measurability: The performance of digital content can be tracked and analyzed through various metrics, providing insights into audience behavior and preferences.

## Examples of Digital Mediums:
## Digital mediums can take many forms, including but not limited to:

## The importance of the Digital medium is crucial in today's world as it provides a platform for businesses and individuals to communicate, share information, and engage with audiences in a highly interactive and personalized manner.

# What are the outcomes of Digital Medium?

The analysts dive into thirty-nine studies from eight countries that met their selection criteria—the most important of which is that the studies have to be experimental or quasi-experimental; have to compare reading the same narrative in digital and print format for emerging readers between 1 and 8 years old; and have to provide effect sizes or sufficient information for them to be calculated. They are interested in whether digital books have the same effect as paper books on children’s comprehension and vocabulary if the only difference is the reading medium, how a dictionary impacts outcomes, how providing adult support during a book reading session influences the findings, and how the design of digital books might explain their effects, particularly through certain types of storytelling enhancements built into the reading platform. These include typical voice-alouds, but also enhancements that focus a child’s attention on the storyline—such as synchronizing visualizations or actions with the narration—such that the child is given visual and verbal clues.

# What are the findings?

The five main findings reveal that the simple question at the heart of the investigation, paper or digital, is not so simple after all. When comparing digital and paper books that only differed by digitization or lack thereof, paper books outperformed, as the use of digital books showed lower comprehension. But if digital books had story-content enhancements, they were more effective than paper books. The setting also mattered, though. In studies that took place in a school setting, paper books outperformed digital books. But studies that took place at home or in a lab showed no difference. In those studies that included low-income families, paper outperformed digital. In samples that included mainly middle- and high-income families, digital and paper had the same impact. Because the support of adults may have interacted with the medium in similar ways, the researchers tested the effects of enhancements, controlling for that suppor,t and found that so-called dialogic reading activities were more effective during print-book reading than were the enhancements in digital books read independently. If digital books only had a dictionary and no story-content enhancement, there was no difference between digital and paper in terms of comprehension, although the dictionaries did boost vocabulary learning. Finally, genre also mattered. The outcomes were more positive for digital with nonfiction books, while the twelve studies with only fiction texts did not reveal differences between paper and digital.

# How can we change the digital medium?

Personally, I believe we can change the digital medium by being more vast, dynamic, and aware of what content is being posted around social media, etc, as "digital platforms are redefining how we consume stories"
